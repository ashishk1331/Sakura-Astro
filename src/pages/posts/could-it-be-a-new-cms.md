I was about to dive into creating a new project—a CMS (Content Management System), to be precise. However, what I really needed was a simple `git submodule` to manage all the markdown files in my project. Since I was already using meta-frameworks like Astro, I had a content layer for my project. Still, I wanted more independent control over the content, akin to having a standalone data layer that I could easily plug into other projects.

Isn't it sounds like CMS? Yes it do. Hence, I ventured out looking for the same.

What all I was looking for:

1. version control with branching ability
2. nested and linked markdown files
3. independent existence of content
4. flat file nature

I went through,

1. [Tina CMS](https://tina.io/) too heavy and bloated for my use
2. [Pico CMS](https://picocms.org/) written in PHP
3. [Grav CMS](https://getgrav.org/) old ui and heavy as well
4. [Raito CMS](https://raito.arnaud.at/) (my fav) but why a router?

All I wanted was version-controlled markdown with no strings attached—no editors, no dependencies, no extra features!

By the way, the banner features Satoru Gojo, a bold and immensely powerful anime character. Despite his strength, his past is marked by mistakes. After a brief death, he awakened with the ability to make the right moves for himself, embodying resilience and growth.
