        Hello! I'm a web designer and developer. I've build web-based tooling
        like <Label {...PROJECTS["tetra_data"]} /> and <Label
          {...PROJECTS["folder_routing_data"]}
        />. Recently, I've found an unknown attraction towards building web
        services in Go. I wish to onboard the Go and HTMX hype train.

        I am a final-year student pursuing a Bachelor of Technology in Computer
        Science and Engineering at <a href="https://knit.ac.in/"
          >Kamla Nehru Institute of Technology, Sultanpur</a
        >. My journey began during my school days when my computer teacher
        introduced me to algorithms and explained how computers can be helpful.
        I am proud to maintain a CGPA of <em>8.5</em>, even though I consider
        myself a mediocre student yet a fast learner.

      Do you like challenges? So do I. Here are a few for you to try like <Label
        {...PROJECTS["crack_the_nut_data"]}
      /> and <Label {...PROJECTS["days_of_code_data"]} />. Although the 100-day
      challenge is still a work in progress, you can get a taste of what it will
      offer from the website.

        I adore python. Only the computer language! I've used it to do web
        scraping, building APIs and even for image processing. The <Label
          {...PROJECTS["bleach_db_data"]}
        />, <Label {...PROJECTS["image_algos_data"]} /> and <Label
          {...PROJECTS["bf_compiler_data"]}
        /> are written in python. The simplicity of Python has captivated me for
        years. You can write Python as if you were reading English. Here are few
        lines from the zen of python one could also apply in their daily lives.

        If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.

        Yes, I can also build mobile apps using React Native and Expo. I've
        built apps like <Label {...PROJECTS["feather"]} />, <Label
          {...PROJECTS["altar"]}
        />, and <Label {...PROJECTS["commit"]} />. They may not work properly
        because Supabase shuts down inactive project instances. Altar and Commit
        were great exercises for the mind, as I incorporated React Query for
        efficient queries, a mini design system for uniform designs across
        entire application, proper authentication and even animations.

        Web version of feather is also <a
          href="https://feather-roan.vercel.app/">available here</a
        >. However, It has limited set of features and capabilities.

      For my next projects, I'm building a mini ORM for python's sqlite3 module
      and bringing power of xml-like syntax to fastHTML.

      Plus, you can use Python for machine learning tasks and scientific
      computation. Isn't that ironic to hear? Hence, this is my next plan. Soon
      I'll be writing a paragraph about it as well.

      I aim to write more, so I started working on this template. You can expect
      blogs from me nowâ€”maybe one each week. Share your thoughts on Twitter <a
        href="https://twitter.com/AshishK1331"><i>@ashishk1331</i></a
      >. I'd love to hear from you!

        I love listening to <i>Pink+White</i>. Rest I spent listening to <i
          >Chainsmokers</i
        >, <i>Kendrik Lamar</i>, <i>Metro Boomin</i>, <i>Weeknd</i> and <i
          >Kanye West</i
        >. My Spotify wrapped placed me among their top 0.1% listeners. Red
        heart!
