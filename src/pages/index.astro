      Zoro on Frank Ocean's blond. I love listening to <i>Pink+White</i>. Rest I
      spent listening to <i>Chainsmokers</i>, <i>Kendrik Lamar</i>, <i
        >Metro Boomin</i
      >, <i>Weeknd</i> and <i>Kanye West</i>. My Spotify wrapped placed me among
      their top 0.1% listeners. Red heart!

      Hello! I'm a web designer and developer. I've build web-based tooling like <Label
        {...tetra_data}
      /> and <Label {...folder_routing_data} />. Recently, I've found an unknown
      attraction towards building web services in Go. I wish to onboard the Go
      and HTMX hype train.
    </p>

    <p>
      Do you like challenges? So do I. Here are a few for you to try like <Label
        {...crack_the_nut_data}
      /> and <Label {...days_of_code_data} />. Although the 100-day challenge is
      still a work in progress, you can get a taste of what it will offer from
      the website.
    </p>

    <p>
      I adore python. Only the computer language! I've used it to do web
      scraping, building APIs and even for image processing. The <Label
        {...bleach_db_data}
      />, <Label {...image_algos_data} /> and <Label {...bf_compiler_data} /> are
      written in python. The simplicity of Python has captivated me for years. You
      can write Python as if you were reading English.
    </p>

    <p>
      Plus, you can use it for machine learning tasks and scientific
      computation. Isn't that ironic to hear? Hence, this is my next plan. Soon
      I'll be writing a paragraph about it as well. Here are few lines from the
      zen of python one could also apply in their daily lives.
    </p>

      If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
      <br />
      If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      I aim to write more, so I started working on this template. You can expect
      blogs from me nowâ€”maybe one each week. Share your thoughts on Twitter <i
        >@ashishk1331</i
      >. I'd love to hear from you!
