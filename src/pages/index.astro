            Hello! I'm a web designer and developer. I've build web-based
            tooling like <Label {...PROJECTS['tetra_data']} /> and <Label
                {...PROJECTS['folder_routing_data']}
            />. Recently, I've found an unknown attraction towards building web
            services in Go. I wish to onboard the Go and HTMX hype train.

            I am a final-year student pursuing a Bachelor of Technology in
            Computer Science and Engineering at <a href="https://knit.ac.in/"
                >Kamla Nehru Institute of Technology, Sultanpur</a
            >. My journey began during my school days when my computer teacher
            introduced me to algorithms and explained how computers can be
            helpful. I am proud to maintain a CGPA of <em>8.5</em>, even though
            I consider myself a mediocre student yet a fast learner.

            Do you like challenges? So do I. Here are a few for you to try like <Label
                {...PROJECTS['crack_the_nut_data']}
            /> and <Label {...PROJECTS['days_of_code_data']} />. Although the
            100-day challenge is still a work in progress, you can get a taste
            of what it will offer from the website.

            I adore python. Only the computer language! I've used it to do web
            scraping, building APIs and even for image processing. The <Label
                {...PROJECTS['bleach_db_data']}
            />, <Label {...PROJECTS['image_algos_data']} /> and <Label
                {...PROJECTS['bf_compiler_data']}
            /> are written in python. The simplicity of Python has captivated me
            for years. You can write Python as if you were reading English.

            Plus, you can use it for machine learning tasks and scientific
            computation. Isn't that ironic to hear? Hence, this is my next plan.
            Soon I'll be writing a paragraph about it as well. Here are few
            lines from the zen of python one could also apply in their daily
            lives.

            I aim to write more, so I started working on this template. You can
            expect blogs from me nowâ€”maybe one each week. Share your thoughts on
            Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/AshishK1331"
                ><i>@ashishk1331</i></a
            >. I'd love to hear from you!

            I love listening to <i>Pink+White</i>. Rest I spent listening to <i
                >Chainsmokers</i
            >, <i>Kendrik Lamar</i>, <i>Metro Boomin</i>, <i>Weeknd</i> and <i
                >Kanye West</i
            >. My Spotify wrapped placed me among their top 0.1% listeners. Red
            heart!
